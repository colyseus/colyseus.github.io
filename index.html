          <h1>An open letter for the Colyseus community</h1>

          <h2 style="text-align: center;">"Colyseus Arena" has been shut down <br /><small>(31 March, 2023)</small></h2>
          <p style="text-align: center;">"Colyseus Arena" was a managed hosting service provided by the company Lucid Sight, Inc. My contract with this company has also been broken, and I have no connections with them anymore.</p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">Colyseus as an open-source framework will continue to exist, be <strong>free to use</strong>, and <strong>free to self-host</strong>.</p>

          <hr/>

          <h2>Colyseus is fully independent again</h2>
          <p>Colyseus as an open-source framework has been created, led, and maintained by me.</p>
          <p>The project can only continue to evolve and thrive by having a sustainable business behind it. My mission now is to make sure that happens.</p>

          <p>Soon:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Colyseus Cloud</strong> is going to be the replacement for "Colyseus Arena"</li>
            <li>Colyseus <strong>license will change to SSPL</strong> (same as MongoDB) to avoid unfair competition with Colyseus Cloud.</li>
            <li>My <strong>GitHub Sponsors</strong> is now open for anyone who would like to contribute financially to my open-source work</li>
            <li>Colyseus Framework 1.0 is expected to be released no later than 2025</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>A brief summary</h3>

            <li>2018 — Quit my job to focus on Colyseus and freelancing</li>

            <li>2023-onwards — The sustainability issue, <strong>Colyseus Cloud</strong>, and lots of work ahead!</li>
          </ul>

          <hr/>

          <h2>The acquisition</h2>
          <p>In February 2021, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/lucid-sight-acquires-colyseus-open-source-multiplayer-game-engine/">VentureBeat announced that a startup based in Los Angeles acquired Colyseus</a>.</p>

          <h3>Behind the acquisition</h3>
          <p>The proposal was made in December 2020, when I was feeling overwhelmed and frustrated. I was spending countless hours on the project while having very little in return. </p>
          <p>Letting go of ownership of the project was one of the hardest decisions I've ever made. I had to go through tremendous mental gymnastics to detach myself from it while also considering new project(s) to start before the contract with that company would expire.</p>
          <p>The papers were signed in January 2021.</p>

          <h3>After the acquisition</h3>
          <p>I can't share much  due to contract agreements, but I've joined the startup's team and they were lovely with me. It felt surreal that they would refer to "Colyseus" as a real business the whole time. It felt much bigger than it was. I was really excited in the beginning.</p>
          <p>The team managed to launch "Colyseus Arena" (the managed hosting service) a few months after the acquisition. It worked well and was growing steadily.</p>
          <p>By the end of 2021, the upcoming version 0.15 of the framework was ready to be released — which could reduce server costs considerably. Its release was   being postponed until the "Arena" service could support it to avoid user friction. </p>
          <p>"Arena" never supported the upcoming version 0.15. I felt that the work I was doing on the open-source framework wasn't being appreciated enough, and I started to slowly lose my enthusiasm. Eventually, I decided to focus most of my energy on a side project.</p>

          <h3>"Colyseus Arena" shutting down</h3>
          <p>Fast forward to March 31, 2023 — Colyseus Arena had to be abruptly discontinued due to a lack of funds. My contract with the company was also over.</p>
          <p>(I feel really sorry for everyone who had their games and projects affected by this. It wasn't meant to be this way.)</p>
          <p>With the "Arena" service discontinued, Colyseus would serve no purpose to the startup anymore, so they were nice enough to return the ownership of the project to me.</p>

          <h3>Having the ownership back</h3>
          <p>The feelings of attachment to the project were quick to come back after they told me they'd give me back ownership. I immediately began working on my own hosting service.</p>
          <p>I have a new challenge now. Only receiving donations as before won't pay my bills.</p>

          <h3>A business — "Colyseus Cloud"</h3>
          <p>For Colyseus as an open-source framework to continue existing and evolving, it must have a viable business.</p>
          <p>The main purpose of Colyseus Cloud is to offer dead simple and effective Colyseus hosting. </p>
          <p>No serverless, no edge-computing, no auto-scaling, no Kubernetes. (<i>At the time of this writing.</i>)</p>

          <h3>New licensing: MIT → SSPL</h3>

          <p>The license change is meant solely to avoid other <strong>hosting providers</strong> from building custom solutions on top of Colyseus while not giving any value back to the project. </p>
          <p>If you are a hosting provider — please reach out so we can agree on a commercial license.</p>
          <p>For everybody else — nothing has changed. You can still use it, modify it, and self-host it <strong>for free</strong>.</p>
          <blockquote>
            Only the server-side of version 0.15 (and moving forward) will have the license change. The client-side SDKs and related dependencies will continue to be MIT licensed.
          </blockquote>

          <hr>

          <h2>The future [?]</h2>
          <p>I have ambitious plans for Colyseus and even more ambitious plans for a side project I've been working on recently.</p>

          <h3>Colyseus Version 1.0</h3>
          <p>There are many long-lasting bugs, and feature requests that must be taken care of. Version 1.0 must include most of them.</p>
          <p>I don't have a public roadmap yet, but I'm expecting to have version 1.0 released somewhere between the year of 2024 and 2025.</p>
          <p>After the 1.0 release, I'm expecting to explore tighter integration between Colyseus Cloud and user-facing features. It's too soon to share any plans here, but I don't wanna simply copy what the competition is doing.</p>

          <h3>An ambitious side-project [?]</h3>
          <p>The web is about to change completely in the upcoming years when new standards become mainstream: <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html">QUIC</a>, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9114.html">HTTP/3</a>, <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webtransport/">WebTransport</a>, and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-moq/">MoQ</a>.</p>
          <p>During this period between 2021 and 2023, I was researching and prototyping a QUIC implementation in the <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig programming language</a>. It is so primitive at the moment it doesn't even worth sharing.</p>
          <p>Having a set of portable lower-level networking libraries would serve a much broad audience by being reusable mostly anywhere.</p>
          <p>Anyway, this is way more ambitious than Colyseus —  the focus should be 100% on making Colyseus sustainable right now.</p>

          <h2>Thank you for caring for Colyseus ❤️</h2>
          <p>The project has only come this far because of the constant feedback the community has given. I will continue doing my best listening to you and improving wherever possible.</p>
          <p>Yours truly, Endel.</p>
