I'm thrilled to share version 0.16 of Colyseus is here! ðŸŽ‰

This version brings a new iteration of the `@colyseus/schema` library, introducing the `StateView` API, deprecating `@filter()`, and providing quality of life improvements to the framework.

### Introducing `StateView` âœ¨

The `StateView` is the new way to filter data per client. It replaces the `@filter()` and `@filterChildren()` decorators, allowing you to create a "view" that can be used to manually add or remove items visible only to a particular client.

It is still not recommended to rely on `StateView` for big datasets, as it is not optimized for that yet. However, it is a great way to filter data per client, such as "private fields" per schema instance, "level of detail", area-based, team-owned data, and more.

See [`StateView` ðŸ“š](https://docs.colyseus.io/state/view) for more.

### Documentation has been reworked ðŸŽ‰

The documentation got a brand new look, and got restructured, which is now easier to extend and navigate.

### Experimental `WebTransport` support ðŸ”Œ

**WebTransport** is a really exciting new technology. It is built on top of the **QUIC** protocol, which uses **UDP** instead of **TCP**, and in practical terms, it allows for **unreliable delivery of messages** â€” which is a great fit for real-time multiplayer games.

It is important for Colyseus to incorporate the new concepts that `WebTransport` brings, so we can improve its internal and external APIs to support both WebTransport and WebSockets using the same API. In this initial iteration, unreliable delivery is only supported when using `WebTransport` via the `client.sendUnreliable()` method from the client-side. We'd love to support more features in the future, such as unreliable portions of the state, even when using WebSockets.

See [WebTransport ðŸ“š](https://docs.colyseus.io/server/transport/webtransport) for more.

### Quality of life improvements ðŸ› 

**1.** You can now set the `state` and `patchRate` directly on the `Room` class definition, along with `maxClients` and `autoDispose` properties:

```typescript
class MyRoom extends Room {
  state = new MyState();
  autoDispose = false;
  maxClients = 20;
  patchRate = 1000 / 10; // 10 times per second
}
```

**2.** The `onAuth` method now receives a `context` argument instead of `req`:

```typescript
class MyRoom extends Room {
  async onAuth(client, options, context) {
    // - context.token contains the auth token sent by the client
    // - context.headers contains the request headers
    // - context.ip contains the client's IP address
  }
}
```

Both `static` and instance `onAuth` methods are supported and receive 3 arguments. See the differences in [Room Authentication ðŸ“š](https://docs.colyseus.io/auth/room#server-side-onauth-method).

**...** and more! Check out the full [0.16 Release Notes](https://github.com/colyseus/colyseus/releases/tag/0.16.0).

### New, experimental encoding/decoding APIs ðŸ”¢

In order to allow more flexibility and customization, new APIs have been exposed to allow you to encode/decode arbitrary structures without the need to inherit from the `Schema` class. This also allows you to customize the change tracking, encoding, and decoding at the byte level.

See [Advanced Usage ðŸ“š](https://docs.colyseus.io/state/advanced-usage) for more.

### Breaking changes ðŸš¨

Migrating from version `0.15` to `0.16` shouldn't take long. Here's an overview of the breaking changes:

- `@filter()` and `@filterChildren()` have been removed.
- `client.getAvailableRooms()` has been removed.
- `matchMaker.getRoomById()` behaviour has changed.
- Sending schema-encoded messages is now deprecated

See [Upgrading to 0.16 ðŸ“š](https://docs.colyseus.io/upgrading/0.16) for more details.

### The Future: Version 1.0 and Beyond ðŸš€

I'm dedicated to keeping Colyseus **independent** and **open-source**. We're on track to [version 1.0 with a roadmap](https://docs.colyseus.io/roadmap) shaped by community feedback, addressing key issues and outlining our vision for the framework's future.

A huge thank you to our vibrant community, sponsors, and Colyseus Cloud users for making this journey possible!
