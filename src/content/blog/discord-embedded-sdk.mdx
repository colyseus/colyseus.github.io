### Discord & The Embedded App SDK

Discord has long been the go-to platform for communication and community building among game developers & players. It provides the social layer where people hang out before, during, and after games.

Now, with the introduction of the [Embedded App SDK](https://discord.com/build/embedded-app-sdk), Discord has the potential to become a viable publishing platform for your HTML5 multiplayer games. This SDK enables developers to seamlessly integrate their experiences directly within the Discord app via an iframe.

### Example: React Colyseus

The [_"React Colyseus Example"_](https://github.com/discord/embedded-app-sdk/tree/main/examples/react-colyseus) project made by the Discord team showcases how Colyseus can be used to power multiplayer games within a Discord Activity.

In this demo, the Embedded App SDK is used to detect whether the user starts or stops talking, and the game state is updated accordingly.

  </a>
  <p class="text-sm p-3 italic">See the [React Colyseus Example Project](https://github.com/discord/embedded-app-sdk/tree/main/examples/react-colyseus)</p>
</div>

In short, in this demo, Colyseus make it seamless to:

- Group players together in a game room, based on the `channelId` they are in.
- Synchronize the game state between all players in real-time

### Example: Webgame Template

The [Colyseus Webgame Template](https://github.com/colyseus/webgame-template) has been updated to support the Embedded App SDK.

When launched via a Discord Activity, this demo will sign-in the user with Discord to identify its username and be able to store their score in the leaderboard.

Users that join [directly from the website](https://us-lax-af65ebed.colyseus.dev/) are matched together in the same game room.

### iframes, Content Security Policies and URL Mappings

One of the key highlights of the Discord Activities is its sandboxed environment - your app resides within a designated _"discordsays.com"_ URL and is loaded via an iframe.

If your game requires access to external URLs or services, configuring ["URL Mappings"](https://discord.com/developers/docs/activities/development-guides#url-mapping) via the app's developer portal is a must:

<div class="mx-auto mt-6 mb-12 w-sm w-full lg:w-2/3 text-center text-gray-600 ">
  <a href="https://github.com/colyseus/webgame-template">
    <Image src={urlMappings} class="rounded b-1" alt="Discord Developer Portal: URL Mappings" />
  </a>
  <p class="text-sm p-3 italic">Discord Developer Portal → "Your App Name" → Activities → URL Mappings</p>
</div>

Discord will act as a proxy for all requests made from your app, ensuring that the Content Security Policy (CSP) is enforced and that your app is secure.

_The Embedded App SDK is currently in developer preview and has a few limitations. Soon Discord is going to introduce Discovery and Monetization options as well._
